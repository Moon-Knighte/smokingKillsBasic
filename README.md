Basic Smoking Kills Project using HTML, CSS, and Js.
Create HTML Structure:

Set up the basic HTML structure with necessary elements like title, container, person/container, cigarette/container, health bar, health text, and buttons.
Style the Layout:

Use CSS to style the layout, including fonts, colors, alignments, and dimensions.
Add specific styles for the title, cigarette, smoke animation, health bar, and buttons.
Animate the Cigarette:

Implement CSS animations to make the cigarette appear as if it is being smoked.
Use keyframes to define the animation's movement, such as rotation or translation.
Animate the Smoke:

Add smoke animation using CSS keyframes to create the illusion of smoke rising from the cigarette.
Adjust the positioning, size, and opacity of the smoke element to achieve a realistic effect.
Implement Health Bar Functionality:

Use JavaScript to handle the health bar functionality.
Define variables to track the health level and smoking status.
Update the health bar's width and color based on the current health level.
Toggle Smoking:

Add event listeners to the start/stop smoking button to toggle smoking functionality.
When the button is clicked, start or stop the smoking animation accordingly.
Update Health Status:

Define functions to update the health status based on the smoking duration.
Reduce the health level gradually as the cigarette is smoked.
Display Health Text:

Update the health text dynamically based on the current health level.
Change the text color to indicate the health status (e.g., green for good health, orange for moderate health, red for life damage).
Make the Project Responsive:

Ensure that the project layout and animations are responsive across different devices and screen sizes.
Use media queries and flexible units (like percentages) to adapt the layout accordingly.
Refine and Test:

Fine-tune the project's appearance, animations, and functionality to ensure a smooth user experience.
Test the project on various browsers and devices to address any compatibility issues.
By following these steps, you can create a visually appealing and interactive "Smoking Kills" project that effectively conveys the message of the dangers of smoking.
